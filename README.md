# INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

## Introduction

This is a tool created to facilitate inventory management in a store or a warehouse with an added functionality to print out the inventory, authentication, creating new users that have the access to the website, adding/removing items from the inventory. This project was made as a part of DEVSOC projects for the Web-development vertical. The project was built using the MERN( Mongoose, Express, Node JS, and React JS) stack and semantic-UI react.
